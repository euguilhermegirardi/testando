               My background is in Civil Engineering, yet I switched to the field of IT, after seven years of experience in the constructor sector. At first, my focus was on improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React but, currently, I am studying TypeScript. Besides, I am working on personal projects to show the knowledge I have acquired along this journey.
